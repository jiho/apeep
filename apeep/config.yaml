# Characteristics of the acquired images

  # Whether to write the flat-fielded image to disk

# Output image enhancing

  # Whether to write the enhanced image to disk

  # NB: image_size will be converted into a multiple of step_size

  # Percentage below which dark pixels are clipped to black

  # Percentage ablve which pixels are clipped to white
  # in [0,100]; 100 changes nothing, 0 makes everything white
  # most of the image is light grey so values around 50 are common

  # Method to identify particles of interest
  # 'static' uses a fixed value for thresholding
  # 'percentile' considers pixels below a percentile of grey levels
  # 'otsu' uses Otsu thresholding (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otsu%27s_method)
  # 'auto' uses 'otsu' for clean images, 'percentile' otherwise
  method: auto

  # Treshold
  # for method=static : grey value (where 0 is black and 100 is white) below which dark grey pixels are considered as particles
  # for method=percentile : percentage of dark grey pixels to consider as particles
  # in [0, 100]; 0 considers nothing, 100 considers all pixels
  threshold: 0.5

  # Value of variance in grey level below which 'auto' tresholding switches from 'otsu' to 'percentile'
  # sane values are between 0.001 and 0.002
