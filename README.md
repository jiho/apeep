# apeep

`apeep` is a set of tools to process images produced by the In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System ([ISIIS](http://yyy.rsmas.miami.edu/groups/larval-fish/isiis.html)).

It is mostly written in Python (a snake), is meant to deal is data form ISIIS (almost [Isis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isis), the Egyptian deity) so it is called `apeep`, almost [Apep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apep), an Egyptian deity which takes the form of a giant snake! And it is supposed to churn through your data without a peep, of course. (Yes, finding the name took longer than coding the thing...)


## Installation

Tested with Python 2.7, not with Python >= 3 because opencv bindings are hard to get working. The image reading and writing is done through [Open CV](http://opencv.org "OpenCV | OpenCV") because it is fast, fast, fast.

### Python packages

[pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) makes it easy. [Install it](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html) if you do not have it already (usually that just means `sudo easy_install pip`). Then

    sudo pip install numpy
    sudo pip install scikit-image
    sudo pip install matplotlib


### OpenCV

#### OS X

The easiest is via [Homebrew](http://brew.sh "Homebrew — The missing package manager for OS X"). Install homebrew:

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

and then

    brew install opencv

#### Linux

Package managers have prebuilt python bindings. In Debian/Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install python-opencv

However, in Ubuntu 14.04 at least, opencv crashes when reading ISIIS videos (because they have no codec the ffmpeg backend of opencv does not handle that; http://code.opencv.org/issues/1915). Using backends other than ffmpeg has other unsuitable consequences (http://code.opencv.org/issues/4253). The best solution is to patch opencv and recompile it.

### Test installation

In a terminal type

    python

and then at the prompt

    import numpy
    import skimage
    import matplotlib
    import cv2

all this should work, with no warning.

## Develop

```
git clone https://github.com/jiho/apeep.git
cd apeep
python3 -m apeep --debug /path/to/project/directory
```

debug

```
import ipdb

ipdb.set_trace()
```


## Usage

[Download](https://github.com/jiho/apeep/archive/master.zip) the code, unzip it, edit `conf.py` to fit your configuration. At least the `input_dir` and `output_dir` variables need to be changed. Then run with

    ./process.py

At this point, the only documentation is reading the code itself. The variable names in `process.py` should be self-explanatory though.
